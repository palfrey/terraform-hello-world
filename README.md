Welcome to a large pile of hacks masquerading as a PoC. This repository proves that it's possible to write a Terraform Provider in Rust, but does not say it's a good idea. The official docs basically say ["write all providers in Go"](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/best-practices/other-languages.html) and that's definitely the easiest and most supported path. This merely proves other options do in fact work.
